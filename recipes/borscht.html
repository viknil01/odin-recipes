    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Borscht is a sour soup, made with meat stock, vegetables and seasonings, common in Eastern Europe.</p>
    <p>In English, the word "borscht" is most often associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, and cabbage borscht.</p>
